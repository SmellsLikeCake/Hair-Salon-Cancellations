## Raising the bar (charts)

The [Hair-Salon-Bar-Graph-Improvements.ipynb](https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/Hair-Salon-Cancellations/blob/master/Hair-Salon-Bar-Graph-Improvements.ipynb) notebook explains the steps I went through to improve a bar graph. It is written up on my blog at [www.showmeinpictures.com/raising-the-bar-charts](www.showmeinpictures.com/raising-the-bar-charts).

## Research Proposal

The [Hair-Salon-Cancellations-Draft.ipynb](https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/Hair-Salon-Cancellations/blob/master/Hair-Salon-Cancellations-Draft.ipynb) and [Hair-Salon-Cancellations-Final.ipynb](https://github.com/SmellsLikeCake/Hair-Salon-Cancellations/blob/master/Hair-Salon-Cancellations-Final.ipynb) notebooks explain a research proposal for an A/B Experiment to reduce no-shows and cancellations. I completed this work as part of my Data Science Bootcamp with Thinkful.
